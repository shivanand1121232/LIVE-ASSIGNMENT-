This helps to maintain statistical significance and reduce the risk of false positives.\n","2. Increased Statistical Power:\n","\n","Pooling Variance: ANOVA pools the variance from all groups, leading to a more precise estimate of the population variance.\n","Improved Power: This increased precision can increase the statistical power of the test, making it more likely to detect significant differences between groups when they truly exist.\n","3.
